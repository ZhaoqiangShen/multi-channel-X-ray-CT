# Joint image reconstruction method with correlative multi-channel prior for X-ray spectral computed tomography (SOFTWARE)

**The presented software reproduce the numerical results of Inverse Problem [paper](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6420/aaba86). Software generate realisitc 
sythetic multi-energetic tomographic projection data and reconstruct it. Novel correlative multi-channel algorithm compared with other state-of-the-art 
reconstruction algorithms. Note that the GPU Nvidia card is required to use the software.**
