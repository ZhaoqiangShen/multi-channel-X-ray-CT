# Joint image reconstruction method with correlative multi-channel prior for X-ray spectral computed tomography (SOFTWARE)

**The presented software reproduces numerical results of Inverse Problems journal [paper](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6420/aaba86). Software generates realisitic synthetic multi-energetic tomographic projection data and reconstructs it. Novel prior-correlative multi-channel algorithm is compared with other state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms. Note that a GPU (Nvidia) card is required to use the software.** 

## General software prerequisites
 * [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) 
 * C compilers and nvcc [CUDA SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) compilers
